It's a machine-learning project, the Old Car Selling Price predictor, which uses advanced regression models to estimate resale values based on factors like vehicle purchase year, Vehicle mileage, Kilometer Driven, ownership history, petrol or diesel, and Vehicle Types like Electric or Manual. Accompanying this, I developed a user-friendly web application to provide valuable insights for both buyers and sellers, aiding in fair pricing for vintage and used cars.

In this project, I made a model that predicts the price of the old vehicle I have taken the datasets from Kaggle.

Important Libraries that I have used in this model are:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn

In this model, I have used Random Forest Regressor to train the model. It comes under the Ensembling technique.

Through this model, I got the Accuracy of 97%.

I used the pickle file to dump the model into a file that will help to predict the price of an old used car.

Using Flask I made a web application that will predict the price of an old used car.
